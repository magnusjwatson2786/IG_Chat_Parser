# InstaGram Chat Parser

Instagram allows users to download their personal data as a local zip file. But the content of the file are not user-friendly since the data is in JSON format. So, I made this program using Python and PyQt5 to view the JSON in a more easily readable format.

> **Note** Instagram changed the structure as well as JSON format for the user data in Dec 2020.

> If your data was downloaded before Dec 2020, use *IG Chat Parser OD*.

> If your data was downloaded after Dec 2020, use *IG Chat Parser ND*.

> If you are not sure about the date of download, try using both versions, and see which one works for your data.
